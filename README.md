## Project

Extract key information from scientific papers using NER

- The number of scientific papers published per year has exploded in recent years, strengthening its value as one of the main drivers for scientific progress.
- In astronomy alone, more than 41,000 new articles are published every year and the vast majority are available either via an open-access model or via pre-print services.
-  Indexing the articleâ€™s full-text in search engines helps discover and retrieve vital scientific information to continue building on the shoulders of giants, informing policy, and making evidence-based decisions.
- Nevertheless, it is difficult to navigate in this ocean of data; finding articles rely heavily on string matching searches and following citations/references.
- NER helps us extract key information from scientific papers which can help search engines to better select and filter articles.

## Data

- The dataset used in this project is from Workshop on Information Extraction from Scientific Publications (WIESP/2022).
- It comprises of text fragments from astrophysics papers, provided by the NASA Astrophysical Data System with manually tagged astronomical facilities and other entities of interest (e.g., celestial objects).
- [Click Here!](https://huggingface.co/datasets/adsabs/WIESP2022-NER) to access the data.

## Methodology and Result
